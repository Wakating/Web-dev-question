The solution is based on the fact that, we can generate random numbers beyond 100 numbers. The method utilized was to create an @input attribte, which would then call the updateValue method.

The update value method simply checks the input information. If it is beyond 100, the method will fix the input value to be 100. Simlliraly with the length of 0. Negative numbered integers are no longer permitted.

This was all done within App.vue.
